# Blodwen PIXI
Experimental [PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js) bindings for [Idris 2](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2).

---

These are highly experimental bindings for my personal study of PixiJS and the JavaScript compiler of Idris 2. 

The coverage of PixiJS is minimal and it is largely implemented ad hoc.
